EPICS VERSION 4 README
======================

EPICS version 4 [1] is a set of software modules that add to the base [2] of
the EPICS toolkit for advanced control systems. 

This README file describes the download files available for EPICS V4, and
includes all language implementations. 

epics-pvdata is a SourceForge project for managing the development of
EPICS version 4.

VERSION 4.5.0
=============
  
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------

Please see RELEASE_NOTES_CPP.md and RELEASE_NOTES_JAVA.md [25] for summaries of
new features for each language.

v4.5 builds on the enormous performance upgrades of v4.4, with further
performance improvements, usability improvements, and bug fixes throughout the
system.

New features have also been added.

The pvDatabase module, is a record/database framework for providing data
services over pvAccess. It allows potentially complex data flow model based
processing of structured data PVs, either inside an IOC, or standalone.
pvDatabase, which was introduced in the v4.4 release only in C++ form, is now
also available in Java. For v4.5 the C++ pvDatabase has been extended with
simplified monitoring. The C++ version has found particular use for preparation
of detector image data fanout and processing. The Java version shows promise in
such things as monitoring computed accelerator beam optics parameters.

EPICS v4.5 makes it easier than ever to use the Normative Types - the v4
standard types for scientific data. For C++, new wrappers and builders have been
added, and a whole new library to help use the normative types has been added
for Java.

A new easy-to-use synchronous API for pvAccess, has been added, for both C++ and
Java, named pvaClientCPP/Java. The Java API, easyPVAJava gets new features to
support PVs whose value is the composite of multiple channels (NTMultiChannel).
These will be moved to pvaClientJava in following releases.

All the command line tools; pvget, pvput, eget and pvinfo now support Channel
Access as well as the new protocol of EPICS Version 4, pvAccess.

The Python support has been extended to support unions, and to use native Python
methods for get and set operations.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------------
v4.5 supports all versions of EPICS Base since late 3.14.12 (specifically 
including all 3.15 releases. The C++ implementations compile under recent 
versions of Linux, MacOS, VxWorks (6.8 and 6.9) and RTEMS. 

The Java implementation now requires Java 7 or later.

pvAccess parameters, eg EPICS_PVA_ADDR_LIST, are described in the pvAccess 
Configuration spreadsheet [23].

CPU Architectures built and tested are listed in [24].
